    "text": "::: {style=“text-align: center”} ### Hi, ::: asdfas\n::: {style=“text-align: justify”} welcome to my pawsome corner of the internet! I’m Ben, a Dalmatian with a penchant for swimming, devouring delectable treats, and mastering the art of ball-catching. But don’t let my playful antics fool you - I’m also an expert in the fine art of manipulating humans with my undeniable cuteness.\nWhen I’m not splashing around in the water or munching on my favorite snacks, you can find me charming my way into extra belly rubs and treats. My human companions say I’ve got them wrapped around my paw, but hey, who could resist this face?\nAs an academic in the field of Canine Cuteness Studies, I’ve mastered the techniques of puppy eyes and tail wags to achieve optimal results in treat acquisition. My research is ongoing, but preliminary findings suggest that a well-timed head tilt can increase treat yield by up to 41% (p = .049).\nStay tuned for more updates on my adventures and research, and don’t forget to bring a treat next time you visit! :::"
