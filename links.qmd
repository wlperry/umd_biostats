# These are the really helpful links I use a lot

[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - a site that has a lot of good resources

[R Companion](https://rcompanion.org/handbook/) - this is a great stats site with a lot of well done tests

[R4DataScience](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) - this is the book by Grolemund and Whickham that is really good

A fun site is [BlueSky and use #rstats](https://bsky.app/search?q=%23rstats)

Still adding
