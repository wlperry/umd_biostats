# Biostatistics course

Bill Perry

This course will serve as an introduction to reproducible data analysis using R. Specifically the goal is to introduce students to all facets of managing a research project with an emphasis on:

-   Developing questions form observations, hypotheses, and predictions for testing statistically
-   Designing data workflows with data entry, curation, QA/QC, and cleaning
-   Using a controlled vocabulary and organized project structure and documenting the metadata for the project
-   Importing data into R and doing calculations and transformations
-   Visualizing data using ggplot
-   Understanding how to decide on statistical tests that are appropriate - T-Tests - parametric and nonparametric

```         
-   Correlations

-   Linear models

    -   linear regression

    -   multiple linear regression

    -   ANOVA

    -   ANCOVA

    -   GLM and logistic regression

-   Analyzing Frequencies

-   Multivariate Statistics

    -   Principal component analysis

    -   NMDS

    -   Cluster analysis
```

In the main webpage I have provided links to all the information you will need:

-   links to readings that should be read prior to class
-   powerpoint lectures that should be reviewed prior to class
-   in-class activities that will actively cover the materials in the powerpoints
-   weekly homework to do the in class activities on your own using different data
-   assignments that form the crux of the grade and there 4 of them
