## Bill Perry

Department of Biology\
University of Minnesota Duluth

I am a professor specializing in aquatic biology, biogeochemistry, invasion biology, and biostatistics and data analysis. My research focuses on statistical methods for aquatic ecology but am open to any data and science. I am particularily adept at working wtih high frequency data from field monitors.

## Research Interests

-   Aquatic Ecology - lakes and streams
-   Invasion Biology
-   Environmental Monitoring
-   Statistical methods for ecological data
-   Data visualization

## Teaching Philosophy

My goal is to make statistics accessible and relevant by doing code and data collection in the classroom. The hands-on approach to learning, using real-world data and practical examples to illustrate statistical concepts is essential and actively doing the work. I use of modern tools like R and the tidyverse to prepare students for careers in biological research.

## Education

-   PhD in Statistics, University of Notre Dame
-   MS in Biology, University of Cincinnati
-   BS in Biology, University of Cincinnati
