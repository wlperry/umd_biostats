# Lecture 1: My goals

-   How do we make observations and hypotheses?
-   How do we design an experiment
-   How do we collect data?
-   How do we organize, clean, summarize, and view the data?
-   How do we use statistics to test our hypotheses
    -   what tests to use
    -   what are the assumptions
    -   what are the interpretations

# Lecture 1: My expectations

-   Communication
-   Practice
-   Failure
-   Learn to correct and troubleshoot

# **Lecture 1: Science**

-   Way to acquire knowledge, organize it and apply it back to the real world
-   Make predictions and testing these predictions using a falsifiable approach - statistics
-   Explanations that cannot be falsified are not science

# What is Statistics?

# **Lecture 1:** Inductive vs deductive reasoning

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
### **Inductive Reasoning (Specific → General)**

Inductive reasoning involves observing specific cases and using them to form a general conclusion.

**Example:**

1.  Measure **10 pine needles** from a tree - average length is **75 mm**.
2.  Measure **10 more needles** from the same tree and gets similar results.
3.  Measures needles from second tree - average length is **120 mm** .
4.  You **generalize** pine needles from different trees **vary in length**, but each tree tends to have a characteristic range.

**Conclusion (Induction):** *"Pine needle length varies by tree, but each tree seems to have a typical range of lengths.*

**Potential Issue:** Conclusion is **not guaranteed** to be true - based on patterns observed in a sample, and there could be exceptions.

### **Deductive Reasoning (General → Specific)**

Deductive reasoning starts with a general principle and applies it to a specific case.

**Example:**

1.  **General Principle:** *Pine needles from a species of pine tree have a predictable length range (e.g., 70–80 mm).*
2.  **Specific Case:** Collect sample of pine needles and measure them.
3.  **Prediction:** Since its the species the needle lengths **should** fall within 70–80 mm.
4.  **Measurement:** Check the data and confirm needles fall within this expected range.

**Conclusion (Deduction):** *"This tree belongs the species with a needle length range of 70–80 mm, we expect its needle lengths to fall in this range."*

**Stronger than induction** because it's based on a general rule—but if the assumption (length range) is incorrect, conclusion could still be wrong.

### Statistics

-   Design good experiments
-   Design good tests
-   Summarize patterns/data
-   Use to make probabilistic determinations to see if differences are "real"

# Measurements

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Data is obtained through measurement

The world is a messy place and how you measure matters

Our measures depend on

-   accuracy - how close we are to the real value

-   precision - how close all our measurements are but may not be precise
