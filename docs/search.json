The key equivalences are:\n\nANOVA group means = Regression predictions for each group\nF-statistic from ANOVA = F-statistic from regression\np-values are identical in both approaches\n\nThis confirms that both techniques are special cases of the General Linear Model, just expressed in different ways. For a categorical predictor with k levels, we need k-1 dummy variables in the regression approach, with one level serving as the reference category.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

If the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the data is normally distributed.\nFor samples larger than 30, the Central Limit Theorem suggests that the sampling distribution of means will be approximately normal regardless of the underlying distribution.\n\nHomogeneity of Variances:\n\nLevene’s test evaluates whether the variances between groups are equal.\nA p-value greater than 0.05 indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of equal variances.\nAs a rule of thumb, if the variance ratio is less than 4:1, the t-test is reasonably robust to violations of this assumption.\nIf this assumption is violated, we should consider using Welch’s t-test instead, which does not assume equal variances."

If the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the data is normally distributed.\nFor samples larger than 30, the Central Limit Theorem suggests that the sampling distribution of means will be approximately normal regardless of the underlying distribution.\n\nHomogeneity of Variances:\n\nLevene’s test evaluates whether the variances between groups are equal.\nA p-value greater than 0.05 indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of equal variances.\nAs a rule of thumb, if the variance ratio is less than 4:1, the t-test is reasonably robust to violations of this assumption.\nIf this assumption is violated, we should consider using Welch’s t-test instead, which does not assume equal variances."

This is a practical course that will introduce you to the topics of experimental design, hypothesis testing, data analysis and visualization in the ecological sciences context. The goal of the course is to enable you to interpret statistical methods and results in the published literature, carry out your own data analyses and conduct a productive conversation with a statistician. We will learn about common statistical approaches in ecology and use the R statistical computing environment to get practice implementing these approaches. Additionally, this course will provide opportunities for students to practice scientific writing skills.\n\n\n\nLearn some useful data skills nd organizaiton and statistical methods and R skills.\n\n\n\nThe course will be taught in a combined lecture and computer lab format with mostly hands on activities assuming you have read the materials. Some of our meetings will take a primarily lecture and discussion format, others a primarily computer lab format, but most will have elements of both. Lecture portions will be dedicated to taking up homework questions, going over course concepts and discussing examples. Computer laboratory elements will be dedicated to using the R statistical computing package for data analysis and visualization.\nMaterials such as lecture slides, computer labs, homework, and assignments will be distributed through the course Canvas site or on the website. The course will mostly be based on the textbook The Analysis of Biological Data (3rd Edition) Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists (1st edition) by Michael C.

Homework questions will be assigned one class meeting before they are due and will need to be submitted before the start of class. We will spend the portions class taking up and discussing homework questions. I will cold-call students to present and explain their answers to the rest of the class. Homework assignments will receive one of four possible grades: 100% (A) for work that meets or exceeds expectations, 85% (B) for work that meets most expectations, 65% (D) for work that misses most expectations or 0% (F) for work deemed unacceptable.\n\n\n\nmost computer lab exercises will be accompanied by in-class questions and disucssion.

In-class assignments will be graded on the same scale as homework.\nTake-home assignments: four assignments will be completed outside of class. Each assignment will involve the independent analysis, presentation and interpretation of a dataset. The written report will include 3 sections: abstract, statistical materials and methods and results (statistical results and figures/ tables), prepared to “publication quality” standards. Assignments will be graded out of 100% and assessed on metrics including statistical literacy (performing analyses correctly), graphical presentation of data, adherence to correct statistical reporting norms, grammar and the quality/functionality of the accompanying R code.

This is a practical course that will introduce you to the topics of experimental design, hypothesis testing, data analysis and visualization in the ecological sciences context. The goal of the course is to enable you to interpret statistical methods and results in the published literature, carry out your own data analyses and conduct a productive conversation with a statistician. We will learn about common statistical approaches in ecology and use the R statistical computing environment to get practice implementing these approaches. Additionally, this course will provide opportunities for students to practice scientific writing skills."

The experiment was designed with four urchin density treatments (control, 66% of original density, 33% of original density, and all urchins removed) nested within four random patches. Five replicate quadrats were measured within each treatment-patch combination.\nThe traditional nested ANOVA approach can be implemented using a linear mixed-effects model, which provides a more flexible framework for analyzing hierarchical designs. In this case, we’ll use the lme4 package to fit a model where treatment is a fixed effect and patch is a random effect nested within treatment."

However, there was significant variation among patches within treatments (F = r round(F_patch, 2), df = r df_patch, r df_residual, p &lt; 0.001). The variance component for patches nested within treatments (r format(var_comp_patch, digits=2)) indicates substantial spatial heterogeneity in algae cover, highlighting the importance of accounting for this spatial variation in the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 13: Post-hoc Comparisons\nAlthough the main effect of treatment was not significant in the nested ANOVA (p = r format(p_treat, digits=3)), we can still examine the mean differences between treatments to understand patterns in the data. However, we should interpret these with caution given the lack of statistical significance at the α = 0.05 level.\n\n# Calculate estimated marginal means\nemm &lt;- emmeans(nested_model, ~ TREAT)\n\n# Display EMMs with flextable\nas.data.frame(summary(emm)) %&gt;%\n  flextable() %&gt;%\n  set_header_labels(\n    TREAT = \"Treatment\",\n    emmean = \"Estimated Marginal Mean\",\n    SE = \"Standard Error\",\n    df = \"df\",\n    lower.CL = \"Lower CL\",\n    upper.CL = \"Upper CL\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  colformat_double(j = c(\"emmean\", \"SE\", \"lower.CL\", \"upper.CL\"), digits = 2) %&gt;%\n  autofit() %&gt;%\n  add_header_lines(\"Estimated marginal means for each treatment\") %&gt;%\n  theme_box()\n\nEstimated marginal means for each treatmentTreatmentEstimated Marginal MeanStandard ErrordfLower CLUpper CLControl1.309.4112-19.2021.8066% Density21.559.41121.0542.0533% Density19.009.4112-1.5039.50Removed39.209.411218.7059.70\n\n\n\n\nLecture 13: Tukey Pairwise Comparisons\n\ntext\n\n\n# Pairwise comparisons with Tukey adjustment\npairs &lt;- pairs(emm, adjust = \"tukey\")\npairs\n\n contrast                  estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n Control - 66% Density       -20.25 13.3 12  -1.522  0.4553\n Control - 33% Density       -17.70 13.3 12  -1.330  0.5625\n Control - Removed           -37.90 13.3 12  -2.849  0.0615\n 66% Density - 33% Density     2.55 13.3 12   0.192  0.9974\n 66% Density - Removed       -17.65 13.3 12  -1.327  0.5646\n 33% Density - Removed       -20.20 13.3 12  -1.518  0.4573\n\nDegrees-of-freedom method: kenward-roger \nP value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 4 estimates \n\n# # Display pairwise comparisons with flextable\n# as.data.frame(summary(pairs)) %&gt;%\n#   flextable() %&gt;%\n#   set_header_labels(\n#     contrast = \"Contrast\",\n#     estimate = \"Estimate\",\n#     SE = \"Standard Error\",\n#     df = \"df\",\n#     t.ratio = \"t ratio\",\n#     p.value = \"p-value\"\n#   ) %&gt;%\n#   colformat_double(j = c(\"estimate\", \"SE\", \"t.ratio\", \"p.value\"), digits = 3) %&gt;%\n#   autofit() %&gt;%\n#   add_header_lines(\"Pairwise comparisons between treatments (Tukey-adjusted)\") %&gt;%\n#   theme_box()\n\n\n\nLecture 13: Letter Display\n\n# Extract compact letter display for plotting\ncld &lt;- multcomp::cld(emm, alpha = 0.05, Letters = letters)\n\ncld\n\n TREAT       emmean   SE df lower.CL upper.CL .group\n Control        1.3 9.41 12   -19.20     21.8  a    \n 33% Density   19.0 9.41 12    -1.50     39.5  a    \n 66% Density   21.6 9.41 12     1.05     42.0  a    \n Removed       39.2 9.41 12    18.70     59.7  a    \n\nDegrees-of-freedom method: kenward-roger \nConfidence level used: 0.95 \nP value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 4 estimates \nsignificance level used: alpha = 0.05 \nNOTE: If two or more means share the same grouping symbol,\n      then we cannot show them to be different.\n      But we also did not show them to be the same. \n\n# # Display CLD with flextable\n# as.data.frame(cld) %&gt;%\n#   flextable() %&gt;%\n#   set_header_labels(\n#     TREAT = \"Treatment\",\n#     emmean = \"Estimated Marginal Mean\",\n#     SE = \"Standard Error\",\n#     df = \"df\",\n#     lower.CL = \"Lower CL\",\n#     upper.CL = \"Upper CL\",\n#     .group = \"Group\"\n#   ) %&gt;%\n#   colformat_double(j = c(\"emmean\", \"SE\", \"lower.CL\", \"upper.CL\"), digits = 2) %&gt;%\n#   autofit() %&gt;%\n#   add_header_lines(\"Compact letter display of treatment means\") %&gt;%\n#   theme_box()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Treatment Comparisons The mean algae cover for the Control treatment (1.30%) appears considerably lower than for the reduced urchin density treatments (66% Density: 21.55%, 33% Density: 19.00%, Removed: 39.20%). While the visual pattern suggests an inverse relationship between urchin density and algae cover, with complete removal showing the highest algae cover, the nested ANOVA showed that these differences were not statistically significant at the α = 0.05 level (p = r format(p_treat, digits=3)). The high variability among patches within treatments likely contributed to the lack of statistical significance for the treatment effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 13: ANOVA Assumptions Testing\nFor valid inference from ANOVA, several assumptions must be met.

As noted by Quinn & Keough (2002), there were “large differences in within-cell variances” in this dataset, and transformations (including arcsin) did not improve variance homogeneity. However, ANOVA is generally robust to heteroscedasticity with balanced designs, which is why they chose to analyze untransformed data. The residuals vs. fitted plot also shows a pattern of increasing variance with increasing fitted values, confirming the heteroscedasticity.\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 13: Visualization\n\n# Create boxplot\nggplot_boxplot &lt;- ggplot(andrew, aes(x = TREAT, y = ALGAE, fill = TREAT)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, outlier.shape = NA) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.4, size = 1) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"D\", end = 0.85) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Effect of Urchin Density on Filamentous Algae Cover\",\n    x = \"Urchin Density Treatment\",\n    y = \"Filamentous Algae Cover (%)\",\n    caption = \"Figure 1: Boxplots showing the distribution of algal cover across urchin density treatments.\\nDespite visual differences, the treatment effect was not statistically significant (p = 0.091).\"\n  ) +\n  # theme_cowplot() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = \"italic\", size = 10)\n  )\n\nprint(ggplot_boxplot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 13: Means Plot\n\ntext\n\n\n# Create means plot\nmeans_plot &lt;- ggplot(summary_stats, aes(x = TREAT, y = mean, group = 1)) +\n  # geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, shape = 21, fill = \"white\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se), width = 0.2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Mean Algae Cover by Urchin Density Treatment\",\n    x = \"Urchin Density Treatment\",\n    y = \"Mean Filamentous Algae Cover (%)\",\n    caption = \"Figure 2: Mean (± SE) percentage cover of filamentous algae across urchin density treatments.\"\n  ) +\n  # theme_cowplot() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = \"italic\", size = 10)\n  )\n\nprint(means_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 13: Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientific Interpretation Our nested ANOVA analysis revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity in algae cover, with significant variation among patches within each treatment (p &lt; 0.001). Surprisingly, the effect of urchin density treatments on filamentous algae cover was not statistically significant at the α = 0.05 level (p = 0.091), despite apparent trends in the data. The descriptive statistics show a pattern where algae cover appears to increase as urchin density decreases, with the Control treatment (mean = 1.3%) showing minimal algae cover compared to reduced density treatments (66% Density: 21.55%, 33% Density: 19.00%, and Removed: 39.20%). This pattern suggests a potential density-dependent relationship between urchin grazing and algal abundance, but the high variability among patches masked the treatment effect. The substantial variance component associated with patches nested within treatments (294.31, approximately 39.5% of total variance) underscores the importance of spatial heterogeneity in structuring algal communities. This finding highlights the necessity of accounting for spatial variability when designing and analyzing ecological field experiments. From an ecological perspective, these results suggest that while sea urchins may influence algal communities through grazing, local environmental factors and patch-specific conditions play a dominant role in determining algae cover. This has important implications for ecosystem management, as it indicates that the effects of urchin density manipulations may be context-dependent and influenced by local environmental conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Why?\nScientific Communication: How would you concisely summarize these findings in a scientific paper?\nFurther Analysis: What additional analyses might be useful to better understand this dataset?"

    "text": "This is an assignment for you to practice coding and redo the work we do in class with a few twists on a new dataframe practicing to create new projects and writing new code. I realize you could copy the code from lecture and although you will get the code right, I urge you to retype it form scratch as it will be learned so much faster. This is a new language for you and if you dont “type” == “speak” the language you would remember it…. really and try breaking things. Dont be afraid you can download a new version or fix it… that is how we learn."
