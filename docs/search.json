This is a practical course that will introduce you to the topics of experimental design, hypothesis testing, data analysis and visualization in the ecological sciences context. The goal of the course is to enable you to interpret statistical methods and results in the published literature, carry out your own data analyses and conduct a productive conversation with a statistician. We will learn about common statistical approaches in ecology and use the R statistical computing environment to get practice implementing these approaches. Additionally, this course will provide opportunities for students to practice scientific writing skills.\n\n\n\nLearn some useful data skills nd organizaiton and statistical methods and R skills.\n\n\n\nThe course will be taught in a combined lecture and computer lab format with mostly hands on activities assuming you have read the materials. Some of our meetings will take a primarily lecture and discussion format, others a primarily computer lab format, but most will have elements of both. Lecture portions will be dedicated to taking up homework questions, going over course concepts and discussing examples. Computer laboratory elements will be dedicated to using the R statistical computing package for data analysis and visualization.\nMaterials such as lecture slides, computer labs, homework, and assignments will be distributed through the course Canvas site or on the website. The course will mostly be based on the textbook The Analysis of Biological Data (3rd Edition) Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists (1st edition) by Michael C. Whitlock and Dolph Schluter. The text is required and we can talk about how to get it. Other textbooks and resources that you may find of use are:\n\nThe R Book (1st or 2nd edition) by MJ Crawley. Highly recommended as an all-around reference book.\nA Primer of Ecological Statistics (1st or 2nd edition) by NJ Gotelli and AM Ellison.\nBiostatistical Analysis (4th or 5th edition) by JH Zar.\nHandbook of Biological Statistics by JH McDonald (online at http://www.biostathandbook.com/).\nInstitute for Digital Research and Education (https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/dae/).\nA Compendium of Clean Graphs in R (http://shinyapps.org/apps/RGraphCompendium/index.php)\nNumerical Ecology with R by D Borcard, F Gillet and P Legendre. A practical introduction to common multivariate methods in ecology.\nOrdination Methods for Ecologists by Mike Palmer (https://ordination.okstate.edu/)\n\n\n\n\nYour grade will be based on homework, in-class assignments, and take-home assignments:\nI will be making this out of points as we get there\n\n\n\nHomework\n10%\n\n\nIn-class assignments\n20%\n\n\nTake-home assignments (4 assignments)\n70%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou are required to read the class readings (see ‘course schedule’) ahead of each class. Homework questions based on the readings will also need to be completed ahead of many classes. Homework questions will be assigned one class meeting before they are due and will need to be submitted before the start of class. We will spend the portions class taking up and discussing homework questions. I will cold-call students to present and explain their answers to the rest of the class. Homework assignments will receive one of four possible grades: 100% (A) for work that meets or exceeds expectations, 85% (B) for work that meets most expectations, 65% (D) for work that misses most expectations or 0% (F) for work deemed unacceptable.\n\n\n\nmost computer lab exercises will be accompanied by in-class questions and disucssion. You will submit answers to these questions and your functional R code for the exercise by the end of the day of each exercise. In-class assignments will be submitted as QUARTO files. In-class assignments will be graded on the same scale as homework.\nTake-home assignments: four assignments will be completed outside of class. Each assignment will involve the independent analysis, presentation and interpretation of a dataset. The written report will include 3 sections: abstract, statistical materials and methods and results (statistical results and figures/ tables), prepared to “publication quality” standards. Assignments will be graded out of 100% and assessed on metrics including statistical literacy (performing analyses correctly), graphical presentation of data, adherence to correct statistical reporting norms, grammar and the quality/functionality of the accompanying R code. The assignments will comprise 70% of your final grade; A1 will be worth 10% of the final grade, A2 15%, A3 20%, and A4 25%.\n\n\n\nwill be assigned on a straight 10% scale, with 90-100% receiving some form of A, 80-89% some form of B, etc. + and – grades will fall on the upper (&gt;X7) and lower (&lt;X4) end of the ranges, respectively. Percentage grades below 60% are equivalent to an ‘F’ letter grade.\n\n\n\n10% of total possible grade will be deducted per day late in absence of valid excuse. A grade of 0 will be given for assignments that are more than 3 days late.\n\n\n\nValid excuses for missed class or late work consist of subpoenas, jury duty, military duty, religious observances, illness, bereavement for immediate family and NCAA varsity intercollegiate athletics. Conflicts with work, vacations, weddings, travel, or some other private situation that was foreseen will not be accommodated.  For further information on excused absences see https://evcaa.d.umn.edu/excused-absences\n\n\n\nI take plagiarism and academic dishonesty very seriously and will invoke the full weight of UMD-approved sanctions at the first instance of plagiarism. I am happy to answer questions on what is considered a violation of academic integrity in this class. Please also refer to UMD’s academic integrity policy at: https://evcaa.d.umn.edu/student-academic-integrity\n\n\n\nI will enforce, and expect you to follow the University’s Student Code of Conduct. Appropriate classroom conduct promotes an environment of academic achievement and integrity. Disruptive classroom behaviour that substantially or repeatedly interrupts either the instructor’s ability to teach, or student learning, is prohibited. Disruptive behaviour includes inappropriate use of technology in the classroom. Examples include ringing cell phones, text-messaging, watching videos of funny cats (and other videos), playing computer games, doing email, or surfing the Internet on your computer instead of note-taking or other instructor-sanctioned activities. See more here: https://regents.umn.edu/sites/regents.umn.edu/files/2022-07/policy_student_conduct_code.pdf\n\n\n\nIndividuals who have any disability, either permanent or temporary, which might affect their ability to perform in this course are encouraged to inform the instructor at the start of the quarter. Methods, materials or testing may be modified to provide for equitable participation.\n\n\n\nThe University of Minnesota is committed to the policy that all of its students shall have equal educational opportunities. The University expressly forbids discrimination on the basis of race, color, gender, sexual orientation, disability, veteran’s status, ethnicity, religion, creed, national origin or marital status. If you believe that your Ecology instructor has not followed this policy, you are invited to bring this to the attention of the Biology Department Head (207 Swenson Science Building; 218-726-8123).

    "text": "Lecture 1: Syllabus\n\nPlease look over the syllabus as it has all the details of the class and how it will run.\n\n\n\n\nLecture 1: Who am I?\n\n\n\nBill Perry\nOffice is in XXXX\nPhone is XXXX\nEmail is wlperry@d.umn.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 1: My goals\n\nHow do we make observations and hypotheses?\nHow do we design an experiment\nHow do we collect data?\nHow do we organize, clean, summarize, and view the data?\nHow do we use statistics to test our hypotheses\n\nwhat tests to use\nwhat are the assumptions\nwhat are the interpretations\n\n\n\n\nLecture 1: My expectations\n\nCommunication\nPractice\nFailure\nLearn to correct and troubleshoot\n\n\n\nLecture 1: Science\n\nWay to acquire knowledge, organize it and apply it back to the real world\nMake predictions and testing these predictions using a falsifiable approach - statistics\nExplanations that cannot be falsified are not science\n\n\n\nWhat is Statistics?\n\n\nZar (1999) - “analysis and interpretation of data with view towards objective evaluation of conclusions based on the data”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 1: Inductive vs deductive reasoning\n\n\n\nInductive Reasoning (Specific → General)\nInductive reasoning involves observing specific cases and using them to form a general conclusion.\nExample:\n\nMeasure 10 pine needles from a tree - average length is 75 mm.\nMeasure 10 more needles from the same tree and gets similar results.\nMeasures needles from second tree - average length is 120 mm .\nYou generalize pine needles from different trees vary in length, but each tree tends to have a characteristic range.\n\nConclusion (Induction): “Pine needle length varies by tree, but each tree seems to have a typical range of lengths.\nPotential Issue: Conclusion is not guaranteed to be true - based on patterns observed in a sample, and there could be exceptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 1: Inductive vs deductive reasoning\n\n\n\nDeductive Reasoning (General → Specific)\nDeductive reasoning starts with a general principle and applies it to a specific case.\nExample:\n\nGeneral Principle: Pine needles from a species of pine tree have a predictable length range (e.g., 70–80 mm).\nSpecific Case: Collect sample of pine needles and measure them.\nPrediction: Since its the species the needle lengths should fall within 70–80 mm.\nMeasurement: Check the data and confirm needles fall within this expected range.\n\nConclusion (Deduction): “This tree belongs the species with a needle length range of 70–80 mm, we expect its needle lengths to fall in this range.”\nStronger than induction because it’s based on a general rule—but if the assumption (length range) is incorrect, conclusion could still be wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 1: Inductive vs deductive reasoning\n\n\n\nIn reality we are doing both of these processes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we test hypotheses\n\n\n\nStatistics\n\nDesign good experiments\nDesign good tests\nSummarize patterns/data\nUse to make probabilistic determinations to see if differences are “real”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Types\n\n\n\nContinuous\n\nnumeric\n\ndiscrete\n\ninteger or numerical\n\ncategorical\n\nnominal – up, down, right, left…\nordinal – order - a, b, c, d or morning, afternoon, evening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurements\n\n\nData is obtained through measurement\nThe world is a messy place and how you measure matters\nOur measures depend on\n\naccuracy - how close we are to the real value\nprecision - how close all our measurements are but may not be precise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
