How we measure these using calipers?\n    a.  Are there any things we need to pay attention to?\n2.  What are the variables we have identified?\n    a.  **Note is Date the same thing as date?**\n    b.  date\n    c.  group\n    d.  n_s -- north or south or even the degrees\n    e.  wind - windward or leeward as it may change\n    f.  tree_no -- group \\# may work\n    g.  Pine needle length -- len_mm\n        i.  What is the name we use?\n        ii. What are the units?\n        iii. Can we name the variable for both?\n3.  What is meta data?\n    a.  List of variables, description, units, possible values\n    b.  Saved as an associated text file\n4.  Ok so take the measures and recode in the shared google spreadsheet\n\n# One last thing -- Lets Estimate Error\n\n-   Select 3 pine needles and number 1, 2, 3\n-   Open a separate shared spreadsheet\n-   Have everyone measure the 3 needles\n-   Enter their name\n-   Enter pine needle number\n-   Enter the length\n-   Record the length of each\n\n### When done each person can export the shared google drive as a CSV or comma delimited file and as an XLSX or excel file\n\n# Now Lets Open R Studio\n\n1.  Download the compressed file pine_needles.zip\n2.  Unzip this file in both windows and mac as it wont work\n3.  Open the folder and look at what is in there\n4.  Copy the files you have entered data into the data subdirectory with the same names as you see...\n5.  Then open RStudio\n6.  The window will look below -- what is all this stuff...\n\n# RStutio\n\n![](images/rstudio.png){width=\"783\"}\n\n**Important parts of the screen**\n\n-   Console -- this is really R running and R studio is the interface\n-   Terminal -- this is the back end of your computer without windows\n-   Environment -- this is where things in memory are stored like\n    -   Dataframes\n    -   Graphs Files -- these are the files that are available... this now is your home directory Plots -- the plots you create\n-   Help -- some form of help for you\n\nMore later - In the files you will see folders and you can click on them to see what is in there...\n\n**you can also click the dots next to the green arrow to go back up a level** ![](images/uparrow.png){width=\"35\" height=\"18\"}\n\n# Now let open the project that I created\n\n1.  click `file` - `open project` and select the `pine_needles.Rproj` file\n2.  your screen will now change as RStudio knows where home is\n\n![](images/pine_rstudio.png){width=\"543\"}\n\n3.  Note that in the upper right you will see `pine_needles` so you know you are in the right spot\n\n4.  Now click the `scripts folder` where the scripts are stored\n\n5.  Open - `01_plain_r_script_for_pine_needles_blank.R` by clicking on it\n\n6.  Then follow along...\n\n# How does RStudio work with R - \\<-\n\nWe need to cover a bit of syntax in R\n\n-   lets click `file` and `New File ...` and `R file`\n-   this will open a new script file that you can write code and run it with `CTRL` and `return` or on mac `command` + `return`\n-   r is case sensitive so X is different than x\n-   the `<-` is the assignment operator\n-   it stores whatever is on the right in a name that you have on the right\n-   try typing `x<-7` then `return`\n    -   this will store a new object in the environment that is an x and in that is 7\n-   now type x and hit `command` + `return` and see what happens in the console\n    -   a 7 will appear\n-   now type y \\<- 2 and enter\n-   now type x \\* y and `command` + `return`\n    -   you should see that it pmultiplied the x by the y variable and you get 14\n\n# How does RStudio work with R\n\n-   we could do all of our work with R or base R\n-   people have written a lot of helper functions called libries stored in packages\n-   we use these a lot of these\n-   you install teh package one time - a lot like buying a light bulb and screwing it in... you do that once\n-   then you can load the libraries stored in the package each time you use a library\n-   lets see how it works in a scirpt I have made\n\n# Here is the script I provided to work on:\n\n### I have provided a lot of details here so you can see what is going on\n\nYou should have installed packages which is done below The `#` is a comment and allows you to write whatever you want and it won' run\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install packages -----\n# install.packages(\"readxl\")\n# install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach script you run from then on you will load the libraries from within the package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the libraries ----\nlibrary(readxl) # allows to read in excel files\nlibrary(tidyverse) # provides utilities seen in console\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.4     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(here)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nhere() starts at /Users/wlperry/Desktop/www_umd_biostats\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Loading files\n\nNow like we did before with x and y we will do this with a spreadsheet from a CSV file or excel file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will import the excel file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Visualize data\n\nUse GGPlot to graph the data\n\nthe line below loads the dataframe and what the aesthetics are\n\nit does not tell ggplot how to add a layer of the geometry to show the data\n\n## Tapestry Plot ------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  comment = '', fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3)\n\nggplot(data = p_df, aes(x=wind, y=len_mm))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01_2_class_activity_pine_needles_files/figure-docx/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## XY Plot -----\n\nnotice the points are layered on top but some overlap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  comment = '', fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3)\n  \nggplot(data = p_df, aes(x=wind, y=len_mm)) + \n  geom_point() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01_2_class_activity_pine_needles_files/figure-docx/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## XY Plot with dodged points ------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  comment = '', fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3)\n\nggplot(data = p_df, aes(x=wind, y=len_mm)) + \n  geom_point(position = position_dodge2(width=0.2) )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01_2_class_activity_pine_needles_files/figure-docx/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# this dodges the points # position_dodge2 or can use position_dodge depending on grouping\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the other ways to display the data?\n\n## Histogram -----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  comment = '', fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3)\n\nggplot(data = p_df, aes(x=len_mm)) + \n  geom_histogram()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.
